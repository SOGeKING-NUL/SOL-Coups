# SOL COUPS

SOL Coups is a user-friendly application designed to help users buy gift vouchers in exchange for their SOL coins. This project leverages the Solana blockchain to provide a quick and secure way for users to swap their cryptocurrency for gift cards. 

## Getting Started

To view the application correctly, **please make sure to open only the `index.html` file** in your browser. Opening other files directly may cause incomplete or incorrect rendering of the application.

### Prerequisites

1. The latest version of any js supporting webbrowser, eg- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/what-you-make-of-it/).
2. A directory to store all our files seperately :)

### Installing

Download the files and save them to a directory on your local machine. Once downloaded, extract the files, and you're all set!

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `index.html` file in your file system.
2. Ensure that all other files in the project are in their original locations relative to `index.html`.
3. Open `index.html` file in your browser. 

### An Example Run

Following these steps will ensure that the application functions as intended.
If you encounter any issues, please make sure you are running `index.html` and not any other files directly.<br>
<br>
The page should look something like this-

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page1.png' alt='The homepage'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

On providing your email address and amount you want on your gift voucher, sol coups will give you an approximate value of inr you will need to send via crypto to get the voucher you want. The application then takes you to the next page where payment details are finalized.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page2.png' alt='Payment Details'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Once a correct sender's wallet address is provided, user is taken to the payment gateway where awindow of 5 min opens for user to make payment.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page3.1.png' alt='Payment Gateway'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

On successfull payment, text on the page is updated, and an email with a randomly generated code is sent to the user's imputted email.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page3.2.png' alt='Payment Status'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Email that is recieved-
