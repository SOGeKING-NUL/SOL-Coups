# SOL Coups

SOL Coups is a user-friendly application designed to help users buy gift vouchers in exchange for their SOL coins. This project leverages the Solana blockchain to provide a quick and secure way for users to swap their cryptocurrency for gift cards. 

## Running the Application

To view the application correctly, **please make sure to open only the `index.html` file** in your browser. Opening other files directly may result in incomplete or incorrect rendering of the application.

### How to Run

1. Navigate to the `index.html` file in your file system.
