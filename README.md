# SOL COUPS

SOL Coups is a user-friendly application designed to help users buy gift vouchers in exchange for their SOL coins. This project leverages the Solana blockchain to provide a quick and secure way for users to swap their cryptocurrency for gift cards.

## Getting Started

To view the application correctly, please make sure to **open only the `index.html` file** in your browser. Opening other files directly may cause incomplete or incorrect rendering of the application.

### Prerequisites

1. The latest version of any js supporting webbrowser, eg- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/what-you-make-of-it/).
2. A directory to store all our files seperately :)

### Installing

Download the files and save them to a directory on your local machine. Once downloaded, extract the files, and you're all set!

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `index.html` file in your file system.
2. Ensure that all other files in the project are in their original locations relative to `index.html`.
3. Open `index.html` file in your browser. 

### An Example Run

Following these steps will ensure that the application functions as intended.
If you encounter any issues, please make sure you are running `index.html` and not any other files directly.<br>
<br>
The page should look something like this-

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page1.png' alt='The homepage'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

By providing your email address and the desired amount for the gift voucher, SOL Coups will calculate the approximate INR value that you need to send via crypto to receive the voucher. The application then directs you to the next page to finalize the payment details.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page2.png' alt='Payment Details'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Once a valid sender's wallet address is provided, the user is directed to the payment gateway, where a 5-minute window is available to complete the payment.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page3.1.png' alt='Payment Gateway'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Upon successful payment, the text on the page is updated, and an email containing a randomly generated code is sent to the user's provided email address.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page3.2.png' alt='Payment Status'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Email that is recieved-
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/email.png' alt='Recieved Email'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>
